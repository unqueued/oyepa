Version 3.2 (3/May/2011)

- Fixed a bug in the MimeMapper.getIconPath() method. My thanks to
Jeffrey Carpeter for spotting this.

Version 3.1 (21/Feb/2010)

- The document browser now shows an icon indicating the type of each document
as well as the date of the last modification. (By editing the configuration file
cfg.py you can choose to use the "date of last access" instead.) You can also sort
the list of results either by document name or by date.


Version 3.0 (20/Apr/2009)

- Tibor Csogor [tibi@tiborius.net] contributed code that enables much nicer
handling of the list of directories the user speficies in the file
~/.oyepa-dirs. In particular, 

(i) entries in the ~/.oyepa-dirs ending with "/*" are understood as requests
to watch that directory *and all directories underneath it*, recursing all
the way down. Eg, a line "/home/user/project/*" will setup watches on
/home/user/project *and all directories beneath it* (including, eg,
/home/user/project/abc/def/ghj).

(ii) a tilde in an line in ~/.oyepa-dirs is now understood as referring to
the user's home dir. So, you can simply add a dir inside your home dir by
adding the line "~/project" to the config file.

Thank you for this cool code, Tibor!


Version 2.9 (18/Feb/2008)

- Updated code in oyepa-filemon.py so that it works with the latest version
of pyinotify (0.8).

Version 2.8 (18/Feb/2008)

- Added a DONT_QUIT_INSTEAD_EXECUTE_CMD configuration var, which allows
oyepa to run a specified command rather than quit when the user presses the
leave/quit button in "search" mode. This is especially useful when oyepa is
being used as a music jukebox (I use it to hibernate the computer using
TuxOnIce). This option does not affect behavior when tagging a document.

Version 2.7 (25/Dec/2007)

- Fixed a bug in the install script (new file cfg.py wasn't getting
installed).

- Fixed a bug in the new MusicExtensionsWidget (part of the support for
jukebox functionality), in which the getExtensions() method was returning a
string as a list of chars rather than as a one-item list of strings.

- Added a check to the music player (mp.py) so that the user cannot
accidentally start multiple instances at the same time.


Version 2.6 (15/Dec/2007)

- Documents stored as directories and those stored files are now handled in
the same way (only exceptions being (i) when they lack an extension and
(ii) that we always offer a way to "open" a dir without an extension,
namely, using the TERM_HACK).

- We no longer record a default app to open extensionless (file) documents.

- Made a bunch of previously hardcoded decisions configurable in order to
allow this code to be customized for specific settings (eg, run a music
jukebox on your computer).

- Added the musicplayer.py script. It basically uses mplayer to play the
contents of directories holding digital music files. I use it as the app to
open directories with the extension ".album".



Version 2.5 (1/Aug/2007)

- Fixed bug which prevented user from renaming a tag when that operation
would merge two tags.

- wnote now allows the user to select which of the previously created notes
she wants to resume editing (by displaying the first line of text).

- Timestamp used to sort documents is now configurable (defined on top of
fslayer.py). By default mtime is now used (previously I was using atime).

- wnote now uses radio buttons rather than checkboxes (since that is the
convention for exclusive groups of buttons).


Version 2.4 (25/Feb/2007)

- Fixed bug causing an exception whenever an attempt was made to
retag/rename a doc from within the document locator dialog.

- Exceptions are now reported through a GUI dialog.

- Simplified installation process: oyepa-filemon can now simply be started
from the user's xinitrc. It now handles SIGHUP signals, and as such
automatically cleans up after itself when the X server is shut down.

- oyepa-filemon can now be (cleanly) shutdown by sending it a signal; no
longer does it quit by having the ~/.oeypa-filemon.running file removed.


Version 2.3 (19/Feb/2007)

- Brief messages to the user are now conveyed through a unobtrusitve "status
bar" at the bottom, as opposed to those annoying messageboxes.

- Double-clicking on a selected tag now deselects it.

- Upon selecting a document the default app is now identified in the status
bar.


Version 2.2 (16/Feb/2007)

- Fixed spawning of new processes, so that defunct/zombie processes are no
longer left lying around.

Version 2.1 (5/Feb/2007)

- Fixed QString -> python string conversions in wnote.py by converting
QStrings to toLatin1() 

Version 2.0 (20/Jan/2007)

- Complete rewrite, now entirely in Python+(Py)Qt!

- Revamped document locator:

  	   * now supports document copying/moving/removing

	   * now has file type <-> default "open with" app memory

	   * now able to list untagged documents
	   
- Added wnote utility for easy creation of (tagged) notes.

- And, most importantly... name change! : )

Version 1.1 (12/Nov/2006)

- added a GUI document locator/browser!
